# Mouse Transcriptomic Clock

## Overview

Transcriptomic ageing clocks estimate an organism’s biological or chronological age based on high-dimensional profile data. Although this method has worked well for a variety of species and tissues, the possibilities of training transcriptomic clocks using scRNA-seq have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In order to solve this, we converted scRNAseq data into pseudo-bulk RNA-seq data using an aggregation method and investigated the impact of cell type composition on age prediction. My research involved building an ageing clock. Using scRNA-seq data from mouse lungs that covered all cell types, the clock examined the impact of ageing on several cell types within the same organ.

I developed a transcriptomic clock using elastic-net regression techniques and utilised converted pseudobulk RNA-seq data to train the model. I also employed computational techniques such as feature selection and quantilization in our analysis.
